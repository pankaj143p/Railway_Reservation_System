# Railway Reservation System - IRCTC-like Implementation Status

## Overview
This document summarizes the current implementation status of the IRCTC-like railway reservation system with date-wise booking, seat availability management, and soft delete functionality.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. Train Service Enhancements

- **Enhanced Train Model**: Added `isAvailable`, `isActive`, and `operationalDays` fields
- **Seat Availability APIs**: 
  - `GET /trains/public/{trainId}/availability?travelDate={date}` - Check seat availability for a specific date
  - `GET /trains/public/{trainId}/availability/range?startDate={start}&endDate={end}` - Get availability for date range
  - `PUT /trains/{trainId}/book-seats` - Book seats for a specific date
  - `PUT /trains/{trainId}/release-seats` - Release seats for a specific date

#### 2. User Service Enhancements
- **Soft Delete**: Added `isActive` flag to `User` model
- **Admin Controls**: Created endpoints for soft delete/reactivate operations
- **User Management**: Added search and filtering capabilities for active/inactive users

#### 3. Ticket Service Integration
- **Date-wise Booking**: Updated `TicketServiceImplementation` to use new seat availability APIs
- **Enhanced Booking Model**: Added `travelDate` field to `TicketBooking` model
- **Seat Validation**: Integrated seat availability checking before booking
- **Refund Integration**: Enhanced cancellation with seat release for specific dates

#### 4. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- **SeatAvailabilityDTO**: For seat availability responses
- **TrainSearchRequestDTO**: For public train search requests
- **Enhanced existing DTOs**: Updated to support new fields

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. Service Layer
- **publicTrainService.ts**: Created service for public train APIs (no authentication required)
- **ticketService.ts**: New comprehensive ticket service with date-wise booking support
- **trainService.ts**: Updated existing service with seat availability checking
- **Enhanced Payment Flow**: Updated payment handling to include travel date validation

#### 2. Components
- **DateSeatSelector**: Interactive calendar component for date and seat selection
- **Enhanced Booking Form**: Added travel date field with validation
- **Seat Availability Display**: Real-time seat availability checking

#### 3. Interfaces
- **Train Interface**: Enhanced with new fields for availability and operational days
- **Ticket Interfaces**: Updated with travel date and enhanced booking information

### Database Schema Updates
- **TrainSeatAvailability Table**: New entity for date-wise seat management
- **Enhanced Train Table**: Added `isAvailable`, `isActive`, `operationalDays` columns
- **Enhanced User Table**: Added `isActive` column
- **Enhanced TicketBooking Table**: Added `travelDate` column

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### 1. Public Train Search
- No authentication required for basic train search
- Search by source, destination, and travel date
- Filter by availability and operational days
- Real-time seat availability display

### 2. Date-wise Seat Management
- Separate seat inventory per travel date
- Automatic initialization of seat availability for new trains
- Booking validation against date-specific availability
- Seat release on ticket cancellation

### 3. Soft Delete System
- Users and trains marked as inactive instead of deletion
- Admin confirmation dialogs before soft delete operations
- Reactivation capabilities for both users and trains
- Filtered queries to show only active records by default

### 4. Enhanced Booking Flow
- Travel date selection with calendar interface
- Real-time seat availability checking
- Seat count validation against available seats
- Integrated payment processing with date-wise booking

### 5. Admin Controls
- Soft delete/reactivate operations for users and trains
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Search and filter capabilities for user/train management
- Seat availability management tools

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Microservices Architecture
- **Train Service**: Handles train data, routes, and seat management
- **User Service**: Manages user authentication and profiles
- **Ticket Service**: Processes bookings and integrates with payment
- **Payment Service**: Handles payment processing and refunds
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests and handles authentication

### API Design
- **Public Endpoints**: No authentication required for basic search
- **Protected Endpoints**: Authentication required for booking and user operations
- **Admin Endpoints**: Role-based access for administrative operations
- **RESTful Design**: Consistent API patterns across all services

### Data Consistency
- **Transactional Booking**: Ensures seat availability and booking consistency
- **Compensation Patterns**: Automatic seat release on booking failure
- **Audit Trails**: Track all booking and seat management operations

## üìä Current API Endpoints

### Public Train APIs
```
GET /trains/public/search?source={source}&destination={destination}&travelDate={date}
GET /trains/public/all
GET /trains/public/{trainId}
GET /trains/public/{trainId}/availability?travelDate={date}
GET /trains/public/{trainId}/availability/range?startDate={start}&endDate={end}
GET /trains/public/{trainId}/route
```

### Protected Train APIs
```
PUT /trains/{trainId}/book-seats
PUT /trains/{trainId}/release-seats
PUT /trains/{trainId}/soft-delete
PUT /trains/{trainId}/reactivate
```

### Ticket APIs
```
POST /tickets/book/{trainId}
GET /tickets/{ticketId}
GET /tickets/user/{userEmail}
PUT /tickets/cancel-with-refund/{ticketId}
```

### User Management APIs
```
PUT /users/{userId}/soft-delete
PUT /users/{userId}/reactivate
GET /users/search?query={query}
```

## üéØ Next Steps (If Needed)

### Frontend Enhancements
1. **Admin Dashboard**: Complete admin interface for user/train management
2. **Booking History**: Enhanced ticket history with travel dates
3. **Seat Map Visualization**: Visual seat selection interface
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live seat availability

### Backend Optimizations
1. **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequent seat availability queries
2. **Analytics**: Add booking analytics and reporting
3. **Notification Service**: Enhanced email/SMS notifications with travel details
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for public APIs

### Testing
